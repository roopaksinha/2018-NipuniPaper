\begin{abstract}
Our homes are getting smarter, thanks to the larger variety of sensor and actuator devices that can be integrated to provide complex services.
However, a key technical challenge is writing complex smart-home applications that can automatically operate in different smart-homes and use any available devices dynamically. This issue becomes amplified when domain-experts, such as doctors, who are not proficient in software development, are tasked with designing these applications. 

In this paper, we identify UML Activity Diagrams as the most appropriate visual design model that can be used intuitively by domain-experts to design smart-home applications. Then, through comprehensive architecture design, we propose a complete \textit{automatic translation tool}, which provides a fully-featured UML Activity Diagram editor and the first compiler (to the best of our knowledge) to convert Activity Diagram designs into highly flexible code that can run in any smart-home system. 
Our evaluation of the automatic translation tool shows that it provides many necessary improvements in usability, bringing us a step closer to deploying apps designed by domain-experts into our smart-homes.
